## Installation

The following section explains how to install MinUI using macOS, without having to
download any additional tools.

### Prerequisites

- A new 64GB microSD card from a reputable brand
- The offical Anbernic RG355XX firmware (`35XX-64GB230309EN.IMG`)
- A [MinUI release](https://github.com/shauninman/union-minui/releases)
- An [administrator user account](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-users-groups-settings-mtusr001/mac)
- [Full Disk Access](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-privacy-security-settings-on-mac-mchl211c911f/13.0/mac/13.0)
for the app `Terminal.app`

### Install MinUI

1. Connect your microSD card to your Mac
1. Start the app `Terminal`
1. Run the command `diskutil list` and identify your microSD by looking at the `SIZE`
column. It is `/dev/disk4` in this example.
1. Run the command `diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk4`
1. Unzip the RG35XX firmware to your desktop and then run the command `cd ~/Desktop`
in the Terminal
1. Run the command `sudo dd bs=1m if=35XX-64GB230309EN.IMG of=/dev/disk4` to flash
the firmware onto your microSD. Enter your user account password if prompted. Wait.
1. Run the command `diskutil list` again and identify the largest partition on your
microSD by looking at the `SIZE` column. It is `/dev/disk4s4` in this example. Note
that it differs from the previous path!
1. Run `sudo diskutil eraseVolume FAT32 ROMS /dev/disk4s4` to format that partition
as `FAT32` with the name `ROMS`. Enter your user account password if prompted. Wait.
1. You should now have a `misc` and a `ROMS` disk connected to your Mac. If you
don't then try reconnecting your microSD card to your Mac.
1. Unzip the MinUI release to your desktop
1. Copy `dmenu.bin` to the root of the `misc` disk. Copy `MinUI.zip` and the `Bios`,
`Roms`, `Saves` folders to the root of the `ROMS` disk. Optionally, follow the additional
instructions in the MinUI README if you wish.
1. Finally, run `dot_clean -m /Volumes/misc` and `dotclean -m /Volumes/ROMS` to
remove any dot-underscore files created by macOS on your microSD.

Done. Insert your microSD to your RG35XX and boot it up!
